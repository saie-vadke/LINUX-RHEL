*--------------------Control Service and Daemons--------------------*


*--------------------what is process--------------------*

   A process is an instance of a particular executable ( .exe program file) running. A given application may have several processes running simultaneously.
  
  
*--------------------what is Daemons--------------------*

   The word "daemon" actually comes from the Greek language, meaning an "inner or attendant spirit" (Oxford American Dictionary).
   This is a fitting name, as a computer daemon is a constantly running program that triggers actions when it receives certain input.
   
   
 *--------------------what is Service--------------------*
 
    A service is a program which responds to requests from other programs over some inter-process communication mechanism (usually over a network).
    A service is what a server provides. For example, the NFS port mapping service is provided as a separate portmapservice
