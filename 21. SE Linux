*--------------------SE Linux (Secure Enhanced Linux)--------------------*

  SELinuxgives that extra layer of security to the resources in the system.
  It is designed to protect the server against misconfigurations and compromised daemons.
  It put limits and instructs server daemons what files they can access and what actions they can take by defining a security policy.
  

*--------------------Mode of SE Linux--------------------*

  There are three mode
      1. Enforcing
      2. Permissive
      3.Disabled
      
      
      
  1. Enforcing:  
               SELinuxsecurity policy is enforced.IF this is set SELinuxis enabled and will try to enforce the SELinuxpolicies strictly
               
  2. Permissive:
                 SELinuxprints warnings instead of enforcing. This setting will just give warning when any SELinuxpolicy setting is breached
                 
  3.Disabled:
              No SELinuxpolicy is loaded. This will totally disable SELinuxpolicies.
