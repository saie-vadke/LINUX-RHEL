*--------------------Regular Expression--------------------*

   Regular expressions are special characters which help search data, matching complex patterns.
   
   
1. GREP (Global Regular Expression Print):
     The grepfilter searches a file for a particular pattern of characters, and displays all lines that contain that pattern.
     
     > Search word string in file:
           #grep root /etc/passwd
           
     > Serach a string in multiple files:
           #greproot/etc/passwd/etc/group
           
     > Search string insensitive in file:
           #grep -i Root /etc/passwd
           
     > Serach a string in all files recursively:
           #grep -r root /
  
     > Inverting a string match:
           #grep -v root /etc/passwd
           
     > Display the string match totla line no:
           #grep -c root /etc/passwd
           
     > Display the files name that matches the string:
           #grep -l root /etc/passwd /etc/shadow
           
     > Display the files name that do not contains the string:
           #grep -L root /etc/passwd /etc/shadow
           
     > Display the string match line with number:
           #grep -n root /etc/passwd
           
     > Display the lines that start with a string:
           #grep ^root /etc/passwd
           
     > Display the lines that end with a string:
           #grep /bin/bash$ /etc/passwd
           
     > Serach and redirect output in a new file:
           #grep root /etc/passwd > /mnt/find.txt
           
     
     
     
2. Find:
    The LinuxFind Commandis one of the most important and much used command in Linux systems.
    Find command used to search and locate list of files and directories based on conditions you specify for files that match the arguments.
    Find can be used in variety of conditions like you can find files bypermissions,users,groups,file type,date,sizeand other possible criteria.
    
    
    > find files under home directory:
          #find /home -name india.txt
          
    > find files with SUID permission:
          #find / -perm 4755
          
    > find files with GUID permission:
          #find / -perm 2644
          
    > find files with Sticky bit permission:
          #find / -perm 1755
         
    > using find command based on users:
          #find / -user root
          
    > using find command based on groups:
          #find / -group ibmgrp
          
    > search the file with less than 10 mb in a folder:
          #find /tmp -size -10M
          
    > serach the file with more than 10MB in a folder:
          #find /tmp -size +10M
          
          
          
          
3. WC (Word Count):
    The wccommand is use for the count word and line numbers.
    
    > count numbers of line:
          #wc -l /etc/passwd
          
    > count numbers of word:
          #wc -w /etc/passwd
         
    
    
    
5. HEAD:
    Head command is used for to display top line of the file.
    
    > display top 10 lines of file:
          #head /etc/passwd
          
    > display top specific no line of files:
          #head -n 15 /etc/passwd
          
    
    
    
6. TAIL:
     Tail command is used for to display the bottom line of the file.
     
     > display bottom 10 lines of the file:
           #tail /etc/passwd
           
     > display bottom specific line of the file:
           #tail -n 5 /etc/passwd
           
     
     
     
**********Exam Que on Grep**********
 
 
 Search for the string 'strato' in the file /usr/share/dict/words & copy this to a file /root/lines.txt.The new file should not have any blank spaces or lines.
 The order of the names in the new file should be same as the order in which it appears in the original file
 
 
#grep strato /usr/share/dict/words > /root/lines.txt
