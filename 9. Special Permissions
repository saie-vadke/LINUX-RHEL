*--------------------Three Types of Special Pemission--------------------*
  1.SUID
  2.SGID
  3.Sticky Bit
  
      1. Set User ID (SUID):
         The suid/setuidbit is represented by”s” (4). This special permission allows a user to access files and directories that are normally only available to the owner.
        
         > For set suidpermission
               #chmod u+s sample.txt
                      Or
               #chmod 4644 sample.txt
         
         > For Check
               #ls -l sample.txt

         > For remove suidpermission
               #chmod u-s sample.txt
               
               
               
       2. Set Group ID (SGID):
          When sgid permission is applied to a directory, all sub directories and files created inside this directory will get the same group ownership as main directory
          The octal digit for the sgid is 2.
          
         >  For set sgidpermission
                #chmod g+s /india
                      Or
                #chmod 2755 /india
         
         > For Check:
                #ls -ld /india

         > For remove sgidpermission
                #chmod g-s /india
                
                
                
        3. Sticky Bit:
           The sticky bit is represented byt and octeddigit 1.
           It is mainly used to protect files within a directory.
           If a directory has the sticky bit set, a file can be deleted only by the owner of the file, the owner of the directory, or by root. 
           This is useful for publically accessible directories.
           
           > For set sticky bit permission
                  #chmod +t /share
                        Or
                  #chmod 1770 /share
           
           > For Check 
                   #ls -ld /share
           
           > For remove sticky bit permission
                   #chmod -t /share
