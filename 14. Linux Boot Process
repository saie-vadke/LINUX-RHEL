*--------------------Linux Boot Process--------------------*

  Booting a computer refers to the process of powering on the computer and starting the operating system.
  The boot process loads the operating system into main memory or the random access memory (RAM) installed on your computer.
  
  
*--------------------Run Level--------------------*

  Runlevel is a state of a machine that defines how a machine should be login, what services and scripts should run when a machine starts.
  Once the real file system is mounted, then kernel runs the first process i.e init (Systemd)
  Runlevel are defined from 0 – 6. 
  
  
  > There are 7 Run Levels:
       1. Runlevel 0 – shut down the system
       2. Runlevel 1 – single user mode
       3. Runlevel 2 – multiuser mode without networking
       4. Runlevel 3 – multiuser with text login screen
       5. Runlevel 4- customized runlevel (not in use)
       6. Runlevel 5 – System provide login prompt (GUI)
       7. Runlevel 6 – Reboot System
