*-------------------- Disk Management in Linux--------------------*


*-------------------- Disk Partitioning--------------------*
  Disk partitioning allow a hard drive to be divided into multiple logical storage units called aspartition.
  Separating a disk into partition allow administrator to can use different partition to perform different functions.
  
  
*-------------------- Disk Naming Convention--------------------*
  Linux maintain disk naming convention for SATA ,PATA and Virtual Disk as followsâ€¦
  
  
*-------------------- For SATA --------------------*

DISK 1 -   /dev/sda                                            DISK 2 -    /dev/sdb

Partition 1 /dev/sda1                                          Partition 1 /dev/sdb1
Partition 2 /dev/sda2                                          Partition 2 /dev/sdb2
Partition 3 /dev/sda3                                          Partition 3 /dev/sdb3
.                                                              .
.                                                              .
.                                                              .


*-------------------- For PATA --------------------*

DISK 1 -   /dev/hda                                            DISK 2 -    /dev/hdb

Partition 1 /dev/hda1                                          Partition 1 /dev/hdb1
Partition 2 /dev/hda2                                          Partition 2 /dev/hdb2
Partition 3 /dev/hda3                                          Partition 3 /dev/hdb3
.                                                              .
.                                                              .
.                                                              .



*-------------------- For Virtual --------------------*

DISK 1 -   /dev/vda                                            DISK 2 -    /dev/vdb

Partition 1 /dev/vda1                                          Partition 1 /dev/vdb1
Partition 2 /dev/vda2                                          Partition 2 /dev/vdb2
Partition 3 /dev/vda3                                          Partition 3 /dev/vdb3
.                                                              .
.                                                              .
.                                                              .




*-------------------- Partition Types --------------------*
  Partition divide into three types
           1.Primary Partitions
           2.Extended Partitions
           3.Logical Partitions
           
           
  1.Primary Partitions:
      The number of partition was limited from the very beginning and we can create maximum four partitions. These partitions called primary partitions.
      
  2.Extended Partitions:
      Extended partition use to overcome limit of primary four partition, if we want more than four partition then we can create one of the extended partition 
      within a primary partition.
      
  3.Logical Partitions:
      A Logical partition is a partition that created inside the extended Partition.
      
  
*-------------------- What is file system --------------------*
  A file system is the method and structure that an operating system use to keep files on disk or partition, that is a way of how files are stored on the disk.
   Eg. ext2, ext3, ext4, xfsetc.
   
   A. EXT (Extended file system):
      This is the first Linux file system. It was used in early versions of Linux. It has been removed from RHEL.
      
   B. EXT2 file system:
      This is the second generation of EXT file system.
      It provides very basic features of file system.
      It was developed in 1980.
      It was the default file system before RHEL5.
      It has been deprecated in RHEL7 and would be removed in next version.
      
   C. EXT3 file System:
      This is third generation of EXT file system. This was the default file system in RHEL5. It includes several enhanced features.
      ---It supports file systems up to 16TiB in size.
      ---It supports file up to 2TiB in size.
      ---It supports up to 32000 subdirectories.
      
   D. EXT4 file System:
     This is fourth generation of EXT file system. This was the default file system in RHEL6.
     ---It supports file systems up to 1EiB.
     ---It supports file up 16TiB in size.
     ---It supports unlimited directories.
     ---It uses a series of contiguous physical blocks on hard disk known as extents. The extents are used to improve the performance of very large files.
     
   E. XFS (X-file system) file system:
     ---This file system was developed by Silicon Graphics for their version of UNIX.
     ---Later it was adopted by most Linux distributions including RHEL. This is the default file system in RHEL 7/8.
     ---This file system is based on 64-bit extent. It uses journaling for metadata operations. It supports file systems and files of sizes up to 8EiB.
     
     
     
  > for create Disk Partitioning:
      1. For Show Available Disk :
            #fdisk -l
            
      2. For Show Specific Disk
            #fdisk -l /dev/sdb
            
      3. For Create New Partition
            #fdisk /dev/sdb
            
      4. For update partition table without reboot system
            #partprobe /dev/sdb
            
      5. Create file system on partition (Format)
            #mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1
                    or
            #mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sdb1
            
      6. For mount disk partition
            #mkdir /data
            #mount /dev/sdb1 /data
            
      7. For permanent mount disk partition
            #vim /etc/fstab /dev/sdb1 /data ext4 defaults 0 0
            
            :wq
            
      8. For mount all partition listed in fstabfile
            #mount -a
            
      9.For show mounted partition
            #mount
              Or
            #df -h
