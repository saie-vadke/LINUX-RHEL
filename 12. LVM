*--------------------LVM (Logical Volume Manager)--------------------*

> Storage technology plays a important role in improving the availability, performance, and ability to manage Linux servers.
> One of the most useful and helpful technology to Linux system administrator is Linux Logical Volume Manager(LVM).
> LVM is a widely-used technique and extremely flexible disk management scheme for deploying logical rather than physical storage. With LVM, system administrator can easily
  resize and extend the logical drive when it is required.


*--------------------LVM Created in Three Steps--------------------*
            1. Physical Volume (PV)
            2. Volume Group (VG)
            3. Logical Volume (LV)
            
            

*--------------------LVM structure--------------------*     


            PV ------------------  --------------------LV
                                  |
                                  |
            PV ------------------ VG
                                  |
                                  |
            PV ------------------- --------------------LV
            
            
    
     1. Physical Volume (PV):
         Physical Volume create from One or more entire hard disks or partitions.
         
     2. Volume Group (VG):
         A volume group (VG) is created using one or more physical volumes. You can think of a volume group as a single storage unit.
         The default size of PE is 4MB
         
     3. Logical Volume (LV):
         Logical volumes are block devices which are created from the volume group.
         It is use to store actual data like partition after create the file system.
            
 
*--------------------What is Extents?--------------------*   

    Each volume within a volume group is segmented into small, fixed-size chunks called extents.
    The extents on a physical volume are called physical extents, while the extents of a logical volume are called logical extents.
            
*--------------------Steps for Managed LVM--------------------*             

                               Step I : Create Physical Volume(PV)
                               
             Step1 : For create PV
                     #pvcreate /dev/sdb1
                   
             Step2 : For Display PV
                     #pvdisplay /dev/sdb1
                   
            
            
            
                               Step II : Create Volume Group(VG)
                               
             Step 1: For Create Volume Group default PE size
                     #vgcreate engineering /dev/sdb1
                     
             Step 2 : For display volume group
                      #vgdisplay engineering
                      
                                 OR
                                 
              For Create VG with Specific PE (physical Extends) Size
                      #vgcreate -s 8 engineering /dev/sdb1
                      
                      
                      
                      
                      
                                Step III : Create Logical Volume (LV)
                                
             Step1: For Create LV with Specific PE (physical Extends) Size
                    #lvcreate -l 100 –n /dev/engineering/comp
                    
            Step 2: For display LV
                    #lvdisplay /dev/engineering/comp
                    
                                  OR
                                  
                   For Create LV with Specific MB Size
                    #lvcreate -L 100 –n /dev/engineering/comp
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                                Step IV : Create File System
                                
           Step1: For create partition on LV comp
                  #mkfs.ext4 /dev/engineering/comp
                  
           Step2: For permanent mount partition
                  #mkdir /comp1
                  #vim /etc/fstab /dev/engineering/comp /comp1 ext4 defaults 0 0
                  
               :wq
                  #mount -a
                  #mount
                  
               OR
               
                  #df -h

            For resize VG create PV and then extend VG
          Step 1: For extend VG
                  #vgextend engineering /dev/sdb2
                  
          Step 2: For reduce VG
                  #vgreduce engineering /dev/sdb2
                  
                  
                  
                  
                                   Step VI : Resize LV
                                   
          Step 1: For extend LV
                  #lvextend -L +100 /dev/engineering/comp
                  
          Step 2: For reduce LV
                  #lvreduce -L -50 /dev/engineering/comp
                  
                  
                  
                  
                                  Step VII : Resize LV,VG,PV
                                  
          Step 1: Remove Permanent Mounting Record
                  #vim /etc/fstab
                  
         Step 2: Unmount LVM
                 #umount /comp1
                 
         Step 3: Remove LV
                 #lvremove /dev/engineering/comp
                 
         Step 4: Remove VG
                #vgremove engineering
         Step 5: Remove PV
                #pvremove /dev/sdb1
                
         Step 6: Remove Partition
