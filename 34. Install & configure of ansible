*--------------------Install & configure of ansible--------------------*

    Ansible is the leading free and opensource configuration management, automation tool. With Ansible, Linux users can control and manage
    hundreds of servers from a single server known as the Ansible Control Node.
    Ansible makes it possible for System and Network administrators to provision software and settings on various network devices.
    Ansible can be used to manage both Unix and Windows host systems. Ansible was initially released 7 years ago.
    The latest stable version at the point of writing this note is Ansible 2.11.1.Unlike many other automation tools such as Chef and Puppet,
    Ansible rides on SSH protocol to communicate with remote host systems. Without the need of installing agents on remote systems, 
    Ansible comes highly recommended since very little CPU and RAM resources are used up by remote systems.


*--------------------History ansible--------------------*

    In February 2012 the Ansible project began. It was first developed by Michael DeHaan, the creator of Cobbler and Func, Fedora Unified Network Controller.
    Initially called Ansible Works Inc, the company funding the ansible tool was acquired in 2015 by RedHat and later on, along with RedHat, moved under the umbrella of IBM.
    In the present, Ansible comes included in distributions like Fedora Linux, RHEL, Centos and Oracle Linux.


*--------------------create user & set sudo privilege--------------------*

    Create Secondary user account with sudo permission
    
    #useradd sachin
    #passwd sachin

    #vim /etc/sudoers
    Sachin ALL=(ALL) ALL (line 101)

    :wq


*--------------------verify and install python3--------------------*

    Check python install version
    # python3 -V

    If python not installed then install it following command
    # yum install python3
    # python3 -V


*--------------------set proper ip configuration--------------------*

    To install online tools we required internet connectivity, so
    setup ip proper (Static IP Recommended always for Server)

    #nmtui

    Or

    #nmcli

*--------------------to install Ansible--------------------*

    Switch sachin user account
    #su sachin

    Install ansible using pip3 command
    $pip3 install ansible --user

    To verify ansible install or not
    $ansible --version


*--------------------we nwwt to create the host file in the /etc/ansible directory--------------------*

    Create ansible directory
    $sudo mkdir /etc/ansible
    $cd /etc/ansible

    Create hosts (Inventory) file
    $sudo vim hosts
    [clients]
    192.168.1.3
    192.168.1.4


*--------------------start and enable ssh service--------------------*

    $sudo systemctl status sshd
    $sudo systemctl start sshd
    $sudo systemctl restart sshd
    $sudo systemctl enable sshd


*--------------------generate SSH key and copy it to remote client system--------------------*

    $ssh-keygen
    
    $ssh-copy-id sachin@192.168.1.3

    Note:
    Create sachin user account on client system,here we control multiple
    clients system so create sachin user accont on each client system.


*--------------------use ping module to test ansible--------------------*

    $ansible -i /etc/ansible/hosts clients -m ping
    
    or

    $ansible -i hosts clients -m ping

    The -i option is used to provide path to inventory file. You
    should get the same output for hosts group name.


*--------------------to check the partitions on all remote hosts--------------------*

    $ansible -i /etc/ansible/hosts clients –m command -a "df –h”
    
    
*--------------------to check memory usage on all remote hosts--------------------*

    $ansible -i /etc/ansible/hosts clients –m command -a “free -m”
    
    
*--------------------to check uptime for all 3 servers--------------------*

    $ansible -i /etc/ansible/hosts clients –m command -a “uptime”
